      <p>
        Vroom emerged onto the automotive scene with a mission to revolutionize
        the way people buy and sell cars. Founded in 2012, Vroom quickly made
        waves by offering an innovative online platform that streamlined the
        car-buying process. Our journey began with a vision to eliminate the

        dealerships and navigating complex paperwork. By leveraging cutting-edge
        technology and a customer-centric approach, Vroom pioneered a seamless
        online experience that empowered consumers to browse, buy, and even
        finance their dream cars from the comfort of their own homes. Since our
        inception, we've remained committed to redefining the car-buying
        experience, continually refining our platform and expanding our
        offerings to better serve our growing community of satisfied customers."
